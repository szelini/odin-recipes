        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This is a recipe that my mom got from a coworker and would make regularly when I was young. 
            Galaktoboureko is a traditional Greek dessert made with a custard in a crispy phyllo pastry shell. 
            After all these years it is still a family favorite. I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as we do.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup semolina flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>12 sheets phyllo dough</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Pour milk into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. In a medium bowl, whisk together the semolina, cornstarch, 
                1 cup sugar and salt so there are no cornstarch clumps. When milk comes to a boil, gradually add the semolina mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. 
                Cook, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from heat, and set aside. Keep warm. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer at high speed. Add 1/2 cup of sugar, and whip until thick and pale, about 10 minutes. Stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Fold the whipped eggs into the hot semolina mixture. Partially cover the pan, and set aside to cool. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish, and layer 7 sheets of phyllo into the pan, brushing each one with butter as you lay it in. 
                Pour the custard into the pan over the phyllo, and cover with the remaining 5 sheets of phyllo, brushing each sheet with butter as you lay it down. </li>
            <li>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top crust is crisp and the custard filling has set. In a small saucepan, 
                stir together the remaining cup of sugar and water. Bring to a boil. When the Galaktoboureko comes out of the oven, 
                spoon the hot sugar syrup over the top, particularly the edges. Cool completely before cutting and serving. Store in the refrigerator. </li>
        </ol>
