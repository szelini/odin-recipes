        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This is a lovely, cool, refreshing Greek tzatziki dip that I first tasted and fell in love with in the Greek Islands. 
            It is lovely with hot toasted pita bread and veggies or lamb kebabs! The key is strain the liquid from the cucumber 
            very well so the dip stays creamy and not watery and to always use thick, full-fat Greek yogurt. Low-fat versions won't cut it. Enjoy!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 large cucumber</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 (17.6 ounce) container full fat plain Greek yogurt (such as FAGE TotalÂ®)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together olive oil, vinegar, and garlic in a bowl and let sit while you prepare the cucumber. </li>
            <li>Peel cucumber and cut in half lengthways; scrape out all the seeds. Grate cucumber with a cheese grater into a sieve set over a bowl. Sprinkle with salt. 
                Strain out as much liquid as possible by pressing down in the sieve with the palm of your hand. 
                Alternately you can wring cucumber out in a clean tea towel. Add cucumber and yogurt to the garlic mixture. 
                Mix until well combined and season with salt to taste.  </li>
        </ol>
